# Currency Exchange and Discount Calculation Application

## Overview

This Spring Boot application calculates the total payable amount for a bill in a specified currency after applying discounts. It integrates with a third-party currency exchange API to retrieve real-time exchange rates and provides functionality to calculate applicable discounts. The application exposes a single API endpoint: `/api/calculate` to calculate the payable amount based on user inputs.
